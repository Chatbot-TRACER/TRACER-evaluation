    topping as ham. However, I noticed that the toppings should be unique. Would you
    like to choose different toppings or confirm the order with just ham? Also, could
    you please specify the drinks you would like to order?

    or do I need to choose different toppings?

- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types

    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Could you please tell me how much a large custom pizza with ham, ham, and
    ham costs, along with two Cokes and one water?
- Assistant: A large custom pizza with up to three ingredients costs the same as predefined
    pizzas, which is 20$. Each additional ingredient after the first three costs 50
    cents, but since you only have three ham toppings, there is no additional cost.
    Therefore, the total for the pizza is 20$. For the drinks, two Cokes cost 3$ (1.50$
    each) and one water costs 1$. So, the total for the drinks is 4$. The overall
    total for your order is 24$.
