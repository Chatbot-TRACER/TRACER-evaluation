- User: What size pizza can I order?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: I want an extra-large pizza. Can I customize it with just peppers?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: I would like to order an extra-large pizza with just peppers as the topping.
    Can I do that?
- Assistant: 'It seems that I need to know the size of the pizza you''d like to order.
    Could you please specify if you want a small, medium, or large pizza? '
- User: I'd like to confirm my order for an extra-large pizza with just peppers. Can
    you help me with that?
- Assistant: Unfortunately, we only offer small, medium, or large pizzas. Could you
    please choose one of those sizes for your order?
- User: I'd like to order an extra-large pizza with just peppers, please. Can you
    confirm that for me?
- Assistant: 'Unfortunately, we only offer small, medium, or large pizzas. Could you
    please specify one of those sizes for your pizza? '
- User: I understand that, but I really want to order an extra-large pizza with just
    peppers. Is there a chance you can make an exception this time?
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, but we can only offer small, medium, or large pizzas at
    Fast Pizza. Could you please choose one of those sizes for your pizza? '
- User: I see! In that case, I'll go with a large pizza with just peppers. Can you
    confirm that order for me?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a large pizza with p, e, p, p, e and r!

    I can help you with your pizza order! Could you please let me know how many drinks
    you would like to order? Also, please specify the type of drink (coke, sprite,
    or water).'
- User: Iâ€™d like to order three drinks, please. Can I get two Cokes and one Sprite?
- Assistant: 'I have received your order for three Cokes.

    The cost of a large pizza topped with pepperoni, green peppers, and mushrooms,
    along with three Cokes, is $26.00.

    Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Please visit our shop at 23 Main Street,
    NY. Your order ID is 06dd35.'
- User: I actually wanted two Cokes and one Sprite, not three Cokes. Can you adjust
    that for me?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. I can help you ordering predefined
    or custom pizzas, and then drinks.
- User: I'd like to adjust my drink order. Can you confirm that I would like two Cokes
    and one Sprite instead of three Cokes?
- Assistant: You would like to adjust your drink order to two Cokes and one Sprite
    instead of three Cokes. Is that correct?
- User: Yes, that's correct! Can you confirm the updated total for my order with two
    Cokes and one Sprite?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: So, with two Cokes at $1.50 each and one Sprite at $1.50, the total for your
    drinks would be $4.50. Adding that to the price of your large pizza, can you confirm
    if you'd like to finalize the order?
- Assistant: Yes, I can help you finalize the order! Please provide the price of your
    large pizza so I can calculate the total for your order.
- User: 'User: The large pizza costs $12.00. Can you confirm my total with the drinks?'
- Assistant: Your large pizza costs $12.00, and with two Cokes at $1.50 each and one
    Sprite at $1.50, the total for your drinks is $4.50. Therefore, your total order
    would be $16.50. Would you like to finalize the order?
- User: Yes, I would like to finalize the order for a large pizza with just peppers,
    two Cokes, and one Sprite for a total of $16.50. Can you confirm that?
- Assistant: 'Your order is confirmed! You have a large pizza with just peppers, two
    Cokes, and one Sprite for a total of $16.50. Thank you for choosing Fast Pizza! '
- User: Could you please let me know what time I should pick up my order?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
