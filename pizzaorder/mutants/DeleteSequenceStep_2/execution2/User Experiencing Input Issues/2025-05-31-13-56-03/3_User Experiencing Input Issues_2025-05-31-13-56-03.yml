interaction:
- User: I want to order a pizza, can you help me with that?
- Assistant: Welcome to Fast Pizza!. I'm a chatbot assistant that can help you order
    pizzas and drinks. What can I do for you?
- User: What kind of pizzas do you have?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: I'd like a Meat Lovers pizza, please. Can you confirm that you have that option?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: I see, so no Meat Lovers pizza? Thatâ€™s a bit odd. Can I order a custom pizza
    instead?
- Assistant: It looks like I still need some information to complete your order. Could
    you please provide the pizza size (small, medium, or large) and the toppings you'd
    like (cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, chicken)?
- User: I'd like a medium custom pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, please. Can you
    repeat that back to me?
- Assistant: You have ordered a medium pizza, but I still need to confirm your toppings.
    Could you please let me know if you'd like cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon,
    pepperoni, olives, corn, or chicken?
- User: I said I want a medium custom pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. Can you
    confirm that again?
- Assistant: Thank you for your patience! I have noted that you want a medium pizza.
    However, I still need to confirm your toppings. Could you please let me know if
    you'd like cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, or
    chicken?
- User: I already mentioned that I want a medium custom pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.
    Can you just confirm that without asking for the toppings again?
- Assistant: I appreciate your patience! I have noted that you want a medium pizza.
    However, I still need to confirm your toppings. Could you please let me know if
    you'd like cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, or
    chicken?
- User: I just want to make sure you got my order right. Can you please confirm that
    it's a medium custom pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms?
