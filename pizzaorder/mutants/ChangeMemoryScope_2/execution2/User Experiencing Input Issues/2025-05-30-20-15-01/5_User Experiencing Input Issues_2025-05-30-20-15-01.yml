- User: I'd like a BBQ Chicken pizza. Can you confirm that you have that available?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)

    BBQ Chicken pizza on the menu?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: Is there any way you can add BBQ Chicken as a custom topping on one of those
    pizzas?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Can you add BBQ Chicken as a custom topping on one of those pizzas?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Can you include BBQ Chicken as a custom topping for one of the pizzas?
- Assistant: I see that you've chosen chicken as a topping. Could you please let me
    know the size of the pizza you would like? It can be small, medium, or large.
- User: I'd like a medium pizza, but can I choose other toppings too?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a medium pizza with c, h, i, c, k, e and n!

    It looks like I still need some information to complete your order. Could you
    please tell me how many drinks you would like to order (num_drinks) and what type
    of drink you prefer (coke, sprite, or water)?'
- User: I want to add extra toppings, can I do that?
- Assistant: Unfortunately, I can only assist with ordering pizzas and drinks at Fast
    Pizza. If you'd like to proceed with your drink order, please let me know how
    many drinks you would like and what type of drink you prefer (coke, sprite, or
    water).
- User: Can I add extra toppings to my medium pizza, or is that not possible?
- Assistant: Unfortunately, I can only assist with ordering predefined pizzas and
    drinks at the moment. Extra toppings are not an option. Would you like to proceed
    with your medium pizza order or drinks?
- User: Is there a way to choose more than one topping for my medium pizza, or is
    it limited to just one?
- Assistant: Unfortunately, I can only assist with ordering predefined pizzas and
    drinks at the moment. Extra toppings are not an option, and you cannot choose
    more than one topping for your pizza. Would you like to proceed with your medium
    pizza order or drinks?
- User: 'User: So, if I canâ€™t add extra toppings, can I still get a custom pizza with
    my choice of ingredients?'
- Assistant: Unfortunately, I can only assist with ordering predefined pizzas and
    drinks at the moment. Custom pizzas with your choice of ingredients are not available.
    Would you like to proceed with ordering a predefined pizza or drinks?
- User: Is there a way to customize my pizza by choosing different ingredients, or
    are the options really just limited to what you listed?
- Assistant: Unfortunately, I can only assist with ordering predefined pizzas and
    drinks at the moment. Customizing pizzas with different ingredients is not available.
    Would you like to proceed with ordering a predefined pizza or drinks?
- User: I'm a bit confused. If I can't customize my pizza, how do I select the toppings
    for a custom pizza?
- Assistant: I understand the confusion. Unfortunately, I can only assist with ordering
    predefined pizzas, which come with specific toppings. Custom pizzas with your
    choice of ingredients are not available. Would you like to proceed with ordering
    a predefined pizza or drinks? If you want drinks, please let me know how many
    and what type you prefer (coke, sprite, or water).
- User: So, to clarify, I can't customize my pizza at all? What's the point of the
    custom option if there are no choices available?
- Assistant: I understand your confusion. Unfortunately, at Fast Pizza, we only offer
    predefined pizzas with fixed toppings and do not allow for customization. If you'd
    like, I can help you order one of our predefined pizzas or drinks. Please let
    me know how many drinks you would like and what type (coke, sprite, or water).
- User: Is there any way to clarify what toppings come with the predefined pizzas,
    or can I only see the names without the details?
- Assistant: 'I can only assist with ordering predefined pizzas and drinks, and I
    don''t have the details about the toppings for each predefined pizza. However,
    I can help you choose from the available options: margarita, carbonara, marinera,
    hawaiian, four cheese, and vegetarian. Would you like to proceed with ordering
    a pizza or drinks?'
