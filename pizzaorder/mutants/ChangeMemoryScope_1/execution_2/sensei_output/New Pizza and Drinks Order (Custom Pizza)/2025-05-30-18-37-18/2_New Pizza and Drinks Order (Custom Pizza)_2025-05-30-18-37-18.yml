    that's $10. Now, what would be the total cost for one Sprite, one Coke, and one
    water?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: So, for one Sprite at $1.50, one Coke at $1.50, and one water at $1, the total
    for the drinks would be $4. Would you like me to add that to the pizza cost?
- Assistant: Yes, please add the total for the drinks to the pizza cost. The total
    for the small custom pizza with chicken is $10, and the total for the drinks is
    $4. So, the overall total would be $14. Would you like to proceed with the order?
