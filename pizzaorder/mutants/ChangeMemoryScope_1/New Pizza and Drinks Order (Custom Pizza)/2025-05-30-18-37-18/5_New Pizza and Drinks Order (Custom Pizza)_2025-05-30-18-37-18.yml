- User: What size pizza can I order?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: I'd like to order a medium pizza, please. Can I add mushrooms to it?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: I would like to order a medium pizza, and I want to know if I can add mushrooms
    to it.
- Assistant: Thank you for your order! I see you want to add mushrooms to your pizza.
    However, I still need to confirm the pizza size. Could you please confirm that
    you would like a medium pizza?
- User: Yes, I confirm I would like a medium pizza. Now, can I add more mushrooms?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a medium pizza with m, u, s, h, r, o, o, m and s!

    Thank you for confirming your medium pizza with mushrooms! Now, could you please
    let me know how many drinks you would like to order and what type of drinks (coke,
    sprite, or water) you would like?'
- User: I'd like to order two drinks, please. Can I get one Coke and one Sprite?
- Assistant: 'Got it! I''ve received your order for two Cokes.

    The cost of a medium pizza topped with mushrooms and two Cokes is $21.00.

    Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Please visit our shop at 23 Main Street,
    NY. Your order ID is aaff6a.'
- User: Could you confirm the total cost of my order, including the medium pizza with
    mushrooms and the two drinks?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: I'd like to confirm that I ordered a medium custom pizza with mushrooms, and
    I want to know how much it costs with the drinks included.
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: 'User: So, a medium custom pizza with mushrooms would cost the same as the
    other medium pizzas, which is $15.00. Since I have two drinks, one Coke and one
    Sprite, could you let me know the total cost including the drinks?'
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: I understand that a medium custom pizza with mushrooms costs $15.00. What
    is the price of the drinks?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: So, if I have a medium custom pizza for $15.00 and I order one Coke and one
    Sprite, what would be the total cost?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: If a medium custom pizza is $15.00 and each drink is $1.50, then the total
    cost for your order would be $15.00 for the pizza plus $1.50 for the Coke and
    $1.50 for the Sprite. That would be $15.00 + $1.50 + $1.50, which equals $18.00.
    Is that correct?
- Assistant: Yes, that is correct! The total cost for your order, including the medium
    custom pizza with mushrooms and the two drinks (one Coke and one Sprite), would
    be $18.00. Would you like to proceed with the order?
- User: Yes, I would like to proceed with the order for the medium custom pizza with
    mushrooms and the two drinks, one Coke and one Sprite. Could you confirm the estimated
    pickup time?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Could you give me a rough estimate on how busy you are right now? Would it
    still be around 15 minutes?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: 'User: I understand that it depends on how busy you are, but could you tell
    me if it''s usually a busy time around now? Would I still be looking at about
    15 minutes?'
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: 'User: Can you give me an example of how busy it typically gets around dinner
    time? Would it still be around 15 minutes for my order?'
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. I can help you ordering predefined
    or custom pizzas, and then drinks.
