- User: What kinds of pizzas do you have available?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: I want to order a Custom pizza.
- Assistant: It looks like I still need some information to complete your order. Could
    you please provide the pizza size (small, medium, or large) and the toppings you'd
    like (cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, chicken)?
- User: I’ll go with a medium for the Custom pizza. Now, for the toppings, let’s do
    pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. What drinks do you have available?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a medium pizza with p, e, p, p, e, r, o, n and i!

    Thank you for your pizza order! Now, could you please let me know how many drinks

- User: I’ll take two bottled sodas. Can you make sure they’re both Coke?

- User: What’s the total for that order?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.

    total comes to $17.00. Adding the two Cokes brings the total to $21.00. Would
