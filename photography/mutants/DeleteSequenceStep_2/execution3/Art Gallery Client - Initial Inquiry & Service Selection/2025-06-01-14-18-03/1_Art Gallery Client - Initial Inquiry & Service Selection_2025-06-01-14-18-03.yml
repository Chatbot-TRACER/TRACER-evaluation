    lighting to minimize glare and reflections. Natural light is often ideal, but
    if using artificial lighting, softboxes or diffusers can help achieve a similar
    effect. As for backgrounds, a neutral color that complements the artwork is usually
    recommended to keep the focus on the painting itself. If you have any specific
    preferences or requirements, feel free to share!

    practices include color correction to ensure the artwork's colors are accurately
    represented, cropping to remove any unwanted background elements, and adjusting
    brightness and contrast to enhance the visual appeal. Additionally, some photographers
    may apply sharpening techniques to bring out details in the artwork and remove
    any dust or imperfections that may have been captured during the shoot. If you
    have specific requirements for editing, feel free to let me know!
