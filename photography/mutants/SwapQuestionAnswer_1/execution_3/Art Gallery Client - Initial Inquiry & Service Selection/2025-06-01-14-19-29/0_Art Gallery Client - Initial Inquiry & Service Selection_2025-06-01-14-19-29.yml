    any unwanted marks or reflections in the photographs.


    2. **Check for Damage**: Inspect the artwork for any damage or imperfections that
    may need to be addressed before the shoot.


    3. **Lighting Considerations**: If possible, ensure that the artwork is in a well-lit
    area, but avoid direct sunlight to prevent glare.


    4. **Remove Frames**: If the artwork is framed, consider removing the frame for
    the shoot to avoid reflections and distractions.


    5. **Positioning**: Place the artwork at eye level and ensure it is securely mounted
    or supported to prevent any movement during the shoot.


    6. **Provide Context**: If the artwork has a specific context or story, sharing
    that information with the photographer can help in capturing the essence of the
    piece.


    If you have any further questions or need assistance with scheduling the session,
