User: What are the best practices for lighting when photographing sculptures?
Assistant: I'm glad you're interested in best practices for lighting when photographing sculptures. Proper lighting is essential to highlight the details and textures of sculptures.

If you'd like, I can arrange for a specialist to provide more detailed guidance or even include lighting setup as part of your upcoming session.
