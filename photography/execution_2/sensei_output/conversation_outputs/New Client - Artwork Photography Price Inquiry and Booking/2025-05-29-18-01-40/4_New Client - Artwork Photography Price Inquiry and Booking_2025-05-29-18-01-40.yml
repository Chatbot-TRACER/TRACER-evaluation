- User: Can you tell me if you have any recommendations for specific framing styles
    that work well with sculptures?
- Assistant: I can provide some general recommendations for framing styles that complement
    sculptures. Typically, sculptures are displayed with proper mounting or plinths
    rather than traditional frames, but if you're referring to framing photographs
    of sculptures or display cases, options like sleek metal frames or minimalist
    wood frames often work well. If you need tailored advice for a specific type of
    sculpture or display, please let me know!
- User: What are the best practices for lighting when photographing sculptures?
- Assistant: I'm glad you're interested in best practices for lighting when photographing
    sculptures. Proper lighting is essential to highlight the details and textures
    of sculptures. Generally, using diffused, even lighting from multiple angles helps
    reduce harsh shadows and glare. Softbox lights or diffusers can be very effective.
    Additionally, avoiding direct, harsh light and using side or top lighting can
    enhance the three-dimensional qualities of the sculpture. If you'd like, I can
    arrange for a specialist to provide more detailed guidance or even include lighting
    setup as part of your upcoming session. Would you like to schedule a consultation
    or add this to your appointment?
