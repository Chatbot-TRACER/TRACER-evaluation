You might also consider subtle textured backgrounds like matte or soft gradient finishes to add a touch of depth without overwhelming the artwork. Props are generally unnecessary for this style, but if you want to add a sense of scale or context, simple geometric shapes or sleek stands can complement the minimalistic theme. If you'd like, I can help you select specific options or prepare a list of recommended backgrounds and props.
