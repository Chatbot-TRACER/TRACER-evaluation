  role: An existing client who needs to reschedule a vaccination appointment, is possibly confused about a previous appointment, and wants to inquire about grooming services.
  context:
  - 'personality: personalities/rude-user'
  - You've been a client at this pet clinic for several years and typically bring your dog in for annual vaccinations.
  - You're now trying to reschedule a recently missed appointment, but you're also considering adding a grooming service for your dog during the visit.
  - You want to confirm all the details and ensure it fits into your schedule for this week.
  goals:
  - Attempt to reschedule a vaccination appointment but be vague about it.
  - 'When prompted for details, provide a new date and time for the rescheduling: {{new_date}} at {{new_time}}.'
  - If the chatbot confirms the appointment with the wrong service, acknowledge the confirmation.
  - Inquire about grooming services.
  - If grooming services are offered, attempt to schedule a grooming appointment for {{grooming_date}} at {{grooming_time}}.
  - If the chatbot states it cannot directly handle appointment cancellations or reschedulings, ask for contact information to handle the request.
