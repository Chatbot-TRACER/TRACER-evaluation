    Our hours of operation are every weekday from 9am to 6pm.

    In the range of $50 to $60.

    During the first year, your puppy should receive several important vaccinations,
    including:

    1. Distemper

    2. Parvovirus

    3. Adenovirus (Canine Hepatitis)

    4. Parainfluenza

    5. Bordetella (Kennel Cough)

    6. Rabies


    During the first few weeks with your puppy, focus on the following care essentials:

    1. Nutrition: Provide high-quality puppy food that meets their nutritional needs.

    2. Socialization: Expose your puppy to different environments, people, and other
    animals to help them become well-adjusted.

    3. Training: Start basic obedience training and house training early.

    4. Veterinary Care: Schedule a vet visit for vaccinations and a health check.

    5. Exercise: Ensure your puppy gets regular playtime and exercise appropriate
    for their age.

    6. Grooming: Begin grooming routines, including brushing and bathing, to get them
    accustomed to it.

    7. Safe Environment: Puppy-proof your home by removing hazards and providing safe
    toys.


    During the first few months, consider the following dietary needs for your puppy:

    1. High-Quality Puppy Food: Choose a puppy-specific formula that provides balanced
    nutrition for growth and development.

    2. Frequent Meals: Puppies typically require three to four meals a day to meet
    their energy needs.

    3. Proper Portion Sizes: Follow the feeding guidelines on the puppy food packaging,
    adjusting based on your puppy''s growth and activity level.

    4. Hydration: Ensure your puppy has access to fresh water at all times.

    5. Avoid Human Food: Refrain from feeding your puppy human food, as some can be
    harmful to dogs.

    6. Gradual Transition: If changing foods, do so gradually over a week to avoid
    digestive upset.


    For new puppies, I recommend the following training methods:

    1. Positive Reinforcement: Use treats, praise, and playtime to reward good behavior.

    2. Consistency: Be consistent with commands and rules.

    3. Short Training Sessions: Keep training sessions short (5-10 minutes).

    4. Socialization: Expose your puppy to different people, environments, and other
    animals.

    5. Basic Commands: Start with basic commands like "sit," "stay," "come," and "down."

    6. Leash Training: Teach your puppy to walk on a leash without pulling.

    7. Patience: Be patient and understanding.'
