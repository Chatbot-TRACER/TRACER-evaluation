interaction:
- User: I need to reschedule an appointment I have. The appointment details are incorrect.
    Can you help me with that?

    again?

    earlier is wrong.

- Assistant: 'I have the date and time for your appointment, but I still need to know
    which service you would like to book. Please choose from the following options:
    Physical examination, Vaccination, Dental health and cleaning, or Lab or diagnostic
    testing.'

    next Wednesday at 11:15 AM instead?
