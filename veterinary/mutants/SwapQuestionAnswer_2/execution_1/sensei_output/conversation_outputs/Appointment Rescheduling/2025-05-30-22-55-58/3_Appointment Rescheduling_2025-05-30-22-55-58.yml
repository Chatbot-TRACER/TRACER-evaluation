- User: I need to reschedule an appointment I have. The appointment details are incorrect.
    Can I provide the correct appointment details now?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but I did not understand the last sentence, can you say that
    again?
- User: I would like to give you the correct appointment details now. The new date
    is November 12 at 4:45 PM. Can you update that for me?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for providing the date and time. Could you please let me know
    which service you would like to book? The options are: Physical examination, Vaccination,
    Dental health and cleaning, or Lab or diagnostic testing.'
- User: I need to update the appointment details again, but I think I misremembered
    the time. Is 4:45 PM still okay, or do I actually need to change it to 5:15 PM?
- Assistant: You mentioned 4:45 PM earlier, but if you're unsure, could you please
    confirm whether you would like to keep it at 4:45 PM or change it to 5:15 PM?

- User: I think I should change it to 5:15 PM just to be safe. Can you update the
    appointment for November 12 at 5:15 PM? Also, I’m still not sure what service

    exact date and time we just set?

    5:15 PM instead of 4:45 PM. Can you confirm that?
